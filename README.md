# 🧠 Resume Scoring Flask App

This is a simple machine learning-powered web application built with **Flask** that evaluates a resume by checking it against job-specific keywords and provides a score along with improvement suggestions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Upload resume in `.pdf` or `.docx` format
- Extract text using NLP tools
- Score resumes based on matching industry-relevant keywords
- Display missing keywords for ATS optimization
- Simple and clean web interface
- Easy to customize keywords for different job roles

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-score-app.git
cd resume-score-app
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to:
[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads a resume (`.pdf` or `.docx`)

2. The resume text is extracted using `PyPDF2` or `docx2txt`

3. Predefined keywords (e.g., for "Data Scientist") are matched

4. A score is calculated as:

   ```
   score = (# of matched keywords / total keywords) * 100
   ```

5. Missing keywords are displayed as improvement suggestions

---

## 🛠 Customization

You can update the `TARGET_KEYWORDS` list in `utils/resume_parser.py` to fit different roles:

```python
TARGET_KEYWORDS = ['python', 'sql', 'tensorflow', 'pandas', 'nlp', 'data analysis']
```

---

## 📦 Dependencies

* Flask
* PyPDF2
* python-docx
* docx2txt

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ✅ TODO / Future Improvements

* Add login system for saving user results
* Support multi-role keyword templates
* Use spaCy/BERT for advanced NLP scoring
* Export feedback report as PDF
* Integrate job description comparison
